- v4.0.2: Fixed a bug that results in v4.0.1 overlooking some solutions related to axiom O5.
- v4.0.1: The starting point of ReferenceFinder for web.
  For the most part, it is the same as Lang's original source code (with some refactoring).
  I only did some minor modifications to make it interop with JavaScript.
  Most notably, I have a new `JsonStreamDgmr` class replacing the original `VerbalStreamDgmr`.
